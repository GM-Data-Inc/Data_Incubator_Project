# Data_Incubator_Project
Proposed project

"""The goal of this project is to use satellite data of fire detection to create a ranking system for counties based on fire frequency. Global data of fire detection is provided by the University of Maryland and is available at: 
http://modis-fire.umd.edu/pages/ActiveFire.php?target=GetData
The animation on Figure 1 shows where fires were detected for each day from 01/01 to 08/31 of 2017. To achieve a more accurate system, data for all years in the dataset (2001 onward) will be included. The ranking will be calculated for every month of the year and normalized by the total number of fires per month.   
Given that the cost of fire suppression has increased exponentially over the last two decades (Figure 2, data from: http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_protection/fire_protection_fire_info_redbooks), the ranking system would enable resources to be distributed more effectively on the county level. 
Further home-insurance for wildfire damage has also increased significantly (source: news archives; data not available) and a ranking system could help adjust insurance cost based on fire activity data. 
In the future, each county could use this approach create a prediction grid of fire probability, utilizing the satellite data and combining it with topography and vegetation type data, as well as census data for population density and urbanization to create a fire hazard map with high resolution."""
